## Office Hours Sign-Up  
  
Sudents (current, former, and potential) are encouraged to sign up for office hours periodically so we can discuss course material or your academic and career goals in general.
At present, office hour meetings are by video on Zoom unless otherwise specified.
  
**Sign-up for a meeting slot at [calendly.com/jensteele1](https://calendly.com/jensteele1).**
Calendly will place the meeting on my calendar and send you a calendar invitation with a Zoom link.
