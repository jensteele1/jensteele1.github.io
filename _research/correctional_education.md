This work centers on several meta-analyses of how education programs in carceral settings (e.g., prisons, jails, juvenile detention centers) influence
the academic skills of incarcerated individuals, as well as their recidivism and employment rates after release. It was funded in 2010 by the U.S. Bureau 
of Justice Assistance and led by Drs. Lois Davis and Robert Bozick at the RAND Corporation.
