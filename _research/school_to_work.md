This set of research includes a 2010 project that examined implementation of the Post-9/11 GI Bill for returning military veterans,
as well as a later examination of military veterans' employment and earnings after receiving bachelor's degrees from public, private, 
or for-profit colleges and universities. The more recent work focuses on young people's transitions to postsecondary education and the labor market. 

One newer work-in-progress leverages high school students' geographic distance to colleges and universities to estimate causal 
effects of different kinds of postsecondary institutions (e.g., high-success, competitive, STEM-intensive, and HBCU) on early-career
educational attainment and earnings. Another work-in-progress, exploring how European-style vocational pathways may influence social 
inequality, examines how educational attainment mediates the relationship between young adults' family background and labor market outcomes in 
Spain versus the United States.
